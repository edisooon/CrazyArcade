## Stage
Stage will help you to manage all the entities, all you need to do is inherit from Stage and use AddSprite method to add your entity to the stage.

## Entity
This is the base class of all your entities, this haven't finish yet, you can edit the IEntity Interface and implement IEntity in the Entity base class.

Made examples of creating entities with prefix name some (i.e. SomeControllableEntity)
